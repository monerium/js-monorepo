This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `@repo/postcss-config`: `postcss` configurations
- `@repo/stylelint-config`: `stylelint` configurations
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`'s used throughout the monorepo

### Utilities

- [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo) for monorepo management
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for CSS processing
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
- [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) for commit message linting
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for Git hooks
- [Lint-Staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) for running linters on staged files
- [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated releases

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd js-monorepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd js-monorepo
pnpm dev
```

Note: use `pnpm dev --log-order stream` for a more traditional log output.

### Pipeline

We use [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), for automated releases. The configuration file is located at `release-please-config.json`, and the manifest file is at `.release-please-manifest.json`. In general, you don't need to manually update the manifest file because the release-please action automatically updates it.

If you need to adjust a package version, you can update the `release-please-config.json` file with `"release-as": "0.0.1"` for that package. Just remember to remove it after the release.

To trigger a release, you merge a PR into the main branch. The release process will create a new release branch and a PR. When you merge this PR into the main branch, a release will be created.

The pipeline will automatically publish the following packages if there are changes when a release is created:

- `@monerium/sdk` at 'packages/sdk'
- `@monerium/sdk-react-provider` at 'packages/sdk-react-provider'
- TBD: `@repo/ui` at 'packages/ui'

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```

# FAQ

## I merged a release PR, but it immediately opened a new PR for the same release.

Verify that the package version is not set to a specific version with `"release-as"` in the `release-please-config.json` file. If it is, remove it and merge the PR again.
