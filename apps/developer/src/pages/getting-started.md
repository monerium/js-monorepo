# Monerium developer documentation

## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with the Monerium API to offer your users IBAN's directly connected to their blockchain address. This enables a seamless experience to collect and send money between bank accounts and blockchains over the SEPA network.

## Getting Started

### Sign Up

To get started, head over to our [Sandbox](https://sandbox.monerium.dev) and sign up.

### Creating an App

Once signed up, head over the [developer portal](https://sandbox.monerium.dev/developers) and create an app.

### Obtaining Credentials

After creating an app, you'll receive two sets of credentials:

1. **Authorization Code Flow Credentials**

   - A `client_id` specifically for user authentication flows.
   - Used with PKCE for secure client-side applications.

2. **Client Credentials**
   - A different `client_id` and `client_secret` pair.
   - Used for server-to-server authentication.

Choose the appropriate credentials based on your integration type:

- Use Authorization Code Flow for user-facing applications (web apps, mobile apps)
- Use Client Credentials for backend services and API integrations

## Authorization Code Flow

Our platform supports OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Redirect users to the authorization flow. [1]
2. Handle the authorization code returned.
3. Exchange the code for an access token. [2]

[2] API Documentation: [Access Token](https://monerium.dev/api-docs/v2#tag/auth/operation/auth-token)

### Client Credentials

For server-side authentication, use the `client_id` and `client_secret` to obtain an access token.

Concepts:

- [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) RFC 6749
- [Proof key for code exchange (PKCE)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636) RFC 7636
- [Bearer Authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) RFC 6750
