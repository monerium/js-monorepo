Our CEO explaining what it's all about

## E-money Institution Services

### Monerium: Your Licensed E-money Gateway

As Europe's first licensed e-money institution on blockchain, Monerium provides a secure bridge between traditional banking and blockchain technology. Our IBAN accounts enable seamless transactions between traditional bank accounts and blockchain addresses through the SEPA network.

### Regulated E-money on Blockchain, Instant Settlement

When you send money to your Monerium IBAN, it's automatically converted into regulated e-money tokens on your blockchain address. This enables instant, secure, and compliant transactions across traditional and blockchain networks.

With tokenised money and assets such as securities or crypto on the same ledger, blockchains can conduct real-time delivery-vs-payment with automated actions, leading to clearing and settlement as well as corporate actions handled completely by the technology itself with you in control.

The e-money tokens are standardized to support all major blockchain wallets and smart contract operations.

### Monerium IBAN, your fiat gateway

The Monerium IBAN is directly connected to your blockchain address enables you to seamlessly collect and send euros between bank accounts and blockchains over the SEPA network.

### Money on blockchains, real-time delivery-vs-payment

Money sent to the IBAN is automatically tokenized as e-money directly to your blockchain address.

With tokenised money and assets such as securities or crypto on the same ledger, blockchains can conduct real-time delivery-vs-payment with automated actions, leading to clearing- and settlement as well as corporate actions handled completely by the technology itself with you in control.

The e-money tokens are standardized to support all major blockchain wallets and smart contract operations.

### Monerium API: Full Financial Integration

Our comprehensive API enables complete financial automation:

- Complete overview of your accounts and balances
- Receive notifications and payment details about sender (IBAN, name, message etc.) when payments are received
- Send money from your blockchain address to IBAN via SEPA network

This enables you to completely automate the flow of money and settlements on and off blockchains without going through exchanges. Collect payments over SEPA from business that have not yet joined the blockchain economy and settle on-chain.

### European Licensed E-money Institution

As a licensed electronic money institution (EMI) in Europe, Monerium operates under strict regulatory oversight across the EEA. Our e-money tokens are fully backed by segregated funds and provide a regulated alternative to stablecoins.

To drive mainstream adoption to blockchains and your platform, you need money that lives under a known regulatory regime.
