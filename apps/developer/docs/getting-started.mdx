# Getting Started

Welcome to Monerium! This guide will help you integrate the Monerium API to offer your users IBANs directly connected to their blockchain addresses. Enable seamless money transfers between bank accounts and blockchains over the SEPA network.

## Overview

Before you begin, determine which integration type fits your needs:

:::tip Choose Your Integration Type

**Building a user-facing app?** → [OAuth](#oauth) - Users authenticate with their Monerium accounts

**Automating your own account?** → [Personal](#personal) - Run scripts and backend jobs on your account

**Managing accounts for your users?** → [White-label](#white-label) - Full platform control, Monerium abstracted away

:::

---

## Setup

### 1. Create Your Account

Head over to our [Sandbox](https://sandbox.monerium.dev) and sign up for a developer account.

### 2. Create an App

Once signed up, go to the [developer portal](https://sandbox.monerium.dev/developers) and create a new app. You'll need to select an app type based on your use case.

---

## App Types

Choose the authentication flow that matches your integration needs:

### 🔐 OAuth (User-facing Apps) {#oauth}

**Authentication:** [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)](#auth-flow)

**How it works:** Your app acts on behalf of Monerium users with their explicit consent. Users sign in with their Monerium credentials and grant your app permission to access their accounts.

**Credentials you'll receive:**
- `client_id` - Unique identifier for OAuth flows

**Best for:**
- Web applications
- Mobile apps
- Any app where users authenticate and control their own data

**Pricing:** Free

**Next steps:** [OAuth Implementation Guide →](./authorization)

---

### 🤖 Personal (Own Account) {#personal}

**Authentication:** [Client Credentials Flow](#client-credentials)

**How it works:** Your app performs automated actions directly on your own Monerium account, such as processing payments or checking balances.

**Credentials you'll receive:**
- `client_id` - Unique identifier
- `client_secret` - Secret key for authentication (keep secure!)

**Best for:**
- Backend scripts
- Scheduled jobs
- Internal tooling and automation

**Pricing:** Free

**Next steps:** [Client Credentials Guide →](./authorization#client-credentials-authorization)

---

### 🏢 White-label (Managed Users) {#white-label}

**Authentication:** [Client Credentials Flow](#client-credentials)

**How it works:** Your platform manages users and their payment accounts directly. Monerium is fully abstracted away from your end users—they never see or interact with Monerium.

**Credentials you'll receive:**
- `client_id` - Unique identifier
- `client_secret` - Secret key for authentication (keep secure!)

**Best for:**
- Payment platforms
- Fintech applications
- Services requiring full control over user payment flows

**Pricing:** €5,000/month

## Implementation Guides

### OAuth - Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) {#auth-flow}

For user-facing applications using OAuth with PKCE:

1. Redirect users to the Monerium authorization endpoint
2. Handle the returned authorization code
3. Exchange the code for an access token
4. Use the access token to make API calls

**[📖 Read the OAuth guide →](./authorization)**

### Client Credentials {#client-credentials}

For server-to-server authentication (Personal and White-label):

1. Securely store your `client_id` and `client_secret`
2. Request an access token from the authorization server
3. Use the access token to make API calls

**[📖 Read the Client Credentials guide →](./authorization#client-credentials-authorization)**
