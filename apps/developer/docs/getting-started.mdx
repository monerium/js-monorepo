# Monerium developer documentation

## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with the Monerium API to offer your users IBAN's directly connected to their blockchain address. This enables a seamless experience to collect and send money between bank accounts and blockchains over the SEPA network.

## Getting Started

### Sign Up

To get started, head over to our [Sandbox](https://sandbox.monerium.dev) and sign up.

### Creating an App

Once signed up, head over the [developer portal](https://sandbox.monerium.dev/developers) and create an app.

### Obtaining Credentials

After creating an app, you will receive two distinct sets of credentials, each tailored for specific use cases. Below is a breakdown of these credentials and guidance on how to use them effectively.

### Types of Credentials

1. **Authorization Code Flow Credentials**

   - `client_id`: A unique identifier for user authentication flows.
   - **Use Case:** Designed for secure client-side applications, paired with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to enhance security.
   - **Ideal For:** User-facing applications such as web apps or mobile apps.

2. **Client Credentials**
   - `client_id` and `client_secret`: A pair of credentials used for server-to-server authentication.
   - **Use Case:** Server-to-server authentication.
   - **Ideal For:** Backend services and API integrations, where user interaction is not required.

### Implementing Authorization Code Flow

1. Redirect users to the authorization flow.
2. Handle the returned authorization code.
3. Exchange the code for an access token.

### Using Client Credentials

For server-side authentication, follow these steps:

1.  Use the `client_id` and `client_secret` to authenticate your application.
2.  Request an access token directly from the authorization server.

- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange): A security enhancement for public clients. [RFC 7636](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636)

- Bearer Authentication: A method for transmitting access tokens. [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750)
