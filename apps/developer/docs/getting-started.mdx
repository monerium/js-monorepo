# Monerium developer documentation

## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with the Monerium API to offer your users IBAN's directly connected to their blockchain address. This enables a seamless experience to collect and send money between bank accounts and blockchains over the SEPA network.

## Getting Started

### Sign Up

To get started, head over to our [Sandbox](https://sandbox.monerium.dev) and sign up.

---


### Creating an App

Once signed up, head over the [developer portal](https://sandbox.monerium.dev/developers) and create an app.

#### App Types


:::tip Choose Your App Type
Select the authentication type that matches your use case.
:::

#### 🔐 OAuth (User-facing Apps)  {#oauth}

**Authentication:** [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](#auth-flow)

**Acts on behalf of:** Monerium users with their consent

End users sign in with Monerium and grant your app permission to access their accounts.

- ✅ **Best for:** Web applications, mobile apps, user-controlled data
- 💰 **Pricing:** Free

---

#### 🤖 Personal (Own Account) {#personal}

**Authentication:** [Client Credentials](#client-credentials)

**Acts on behalf of:** Your own Monerium account

Your application performs automated actions on your own Monerium account.

- ✅ **Best for:** Backend scripts, scheduled jobs, internal tooling
- 💰 **Pricing:** Free

---

#### 🏢 White-label (Managed Users) {#white-label}

**Authentication:** [Client Credentials](#client-credentials)

**Acts on behalf of:** Users managed by your platform

Your platform manages users and their payment accounts directly. Monerium is fully abstracted.

- ✅ **Best for:** Payment platforms, fintech applications
- 💰 **Pricing:** €5,000/month

:::info Enterprise Solution
Requires a contract for platforms offering IBAN accounts under their own brand.
:::


#### Choosing the Right App Type
:::tip Ask yourself:
- **Do your users already have Monerium accounts?** → [OAuth](#oauth)
- **Are you building automation for your own business?** → [Personal](#personal)
- **Do you want to manage accounts for your users without them knowing about Monerium?** → [White-label](#white-label)
:::

### Obtaining Credentials

After creating an app, you will receive two distinct sets of credentials, each tailored for specific use cases. Below is a breakdown of these credentials and guidance on how to use them effectively.

### Types of Credentials

#### **Authorization Code Flow Credentials**  {#auth-flow}

   - `client_id`: A unique identifier for user authentication flows.
   - **Use Case:** Designed for secure client-side applications, paired with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to enhance security.
   - **Ideal For:** User-facing applications such as web apps or mobile apps.

#### Using Authorization Code Flow

1. Redirect users to the authorization flow.
2. Handle the returned authorization code.
3. Exchange the code for an access token.

#### **Client Credentials** {#client-credentials}
   - `client_id` and `client_secret`: A pair of credentials used for server-to-server authentication.
   - **Use Case:** Server-to-server authentication.
   - **Ideal For:** Backend services and API integrations, where user interaction is not required.

#### Using Client Credentials

For server-side authentication, follow these steps:

1.  Use the `client_id` and `client_secret` to authenticate your application.
2.  Request an access token directly from the authorization server.
